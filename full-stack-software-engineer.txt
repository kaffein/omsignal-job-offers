OMsignal Full Stack Software Engineer [REMOTE or LOCAL]

Headquarters: Montreal | http://www.omsignal.com

Link to Job Offer: https://github.com/OMsignal/omsignal-job-offers/blob/master/full-stack-software-engineer.md
 
OMsignal is made possible by the expertise of Smart Textile experts, 
Data/Bio Scientists, Hardware, Firmware and 
Software Engineers. Please note that this offer is mostly focused on 
Full Stack Engineers, but we are also looking to 
hire smart Data Scientists who have an interest in biodata and possibly 
people who could help bridging BLE/MSP firmware and driver development.
 
    What we do
    ==========

OMsignal is an exciting Montreal start-up developing a revolutionary 
line of bio-sensing clothes that connect seamlessly 
to smartphones. The company is at the intersection of the wearable 
technology, well-being and fashion markets. 
 
We are a well-funded startup [1] working to deliver a smart biometric 
shirt. You can read more about our mission on [2]. 
And for those who followed the US Open 2014, we are the technology 
behind Ralph Laurent Polo Tech.

We just shipped the product to our first customers.
 
    What we are looking for
    =======================

We are looking for Full Stack Software Engineers who can 
help us to architect, design and implement a complex system based
on bleeding edge technologies (Scala, Akka, Spray, Reactive Programming [3], 
iOS, Swift, Docker...), a modern architectural 
style (Micro Services, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Eventual Consistency), 
and a clean codebase (Clean Code, Domain Driven Design…) -- emphasis on 
the “Engineer” over the “Full Stack” part.
 
In-depth knowledge of the technologies we use is not required, but 
having strong Software Engineering foundations is 
(Algorithmics, Design and Architectural Patterns,  …). 
Understanding that code is read much more often than it is
written is an absolute must. 
 
You should be willing to face the upcoming challenges 
(Machine Learning, Predictive algorithms, 
Opening the platform/iOS SDK/API, -- who knows the rest?…). 
 
And of course, you need to speak/write english fluently 
(we need to understand each other, right ?)
 
     The Technologies we currently use
     =================================

 - Backend : Scala, Akka, Akka Persistence, Spray, ReactiveMongo, SBT, Kafka, ZooKeeper
 - Web : NodeJS, AngularJS
 - iOS : Swift, Objective C, ReactiveCocoa, Core Bluetooth, CocoaPods`
 - DevOps : Ubuntu, Docker, Ruby, Amazon AWS/EC2
 - Project management: git/github
 
The `iOS` stack is more sophisticated than the average iOS App. 
It includes a Pub/Sub system similar 
to `Apache Kafka` (that we call iOS Kafka internally), 
makes heavy use of 
asynchronous programming + `CQRS`/`Event Sourcing` and 
computes biometric algorithms and reports. 
 
    Our culture
    ===========

We get some inspiration from the Open Source model to 
achieve high-cohesion (within teams) and 
low-coupling (between teams) : small, empowered teams, 
systematic pull requests, developer autonomy.
 
Our software engineering practices are also influenced 
by Antifragile [4] principles
(Small is Beautiful, Less is more, Hormesis principle, 
evolutionary darwinism, over-compensation ...)
 
And if you are on the Paleo diet, like hiking/camping or 
enjoy a good raclette you will certainly find friends here!
 
    Next step
    =========

If you are curious about the project and want to explore 
opportunities working with us, you can 
 - reach out to dev@omsignal.com
 - come hang out on IRC (irc.freenode.net #omsignal) to ask your questions
 
If you have a `github`/`bitbucket` account, we would love to take
a look at what you like doing 
(even if you feel ashamed of it in retrospective -- explain us 
what you would improve now)
